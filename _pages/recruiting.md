I am hiring for two <b><i>funded</i></b> Ph.D. openings as I start my lab and research group. If you are interested in developing measurement and data science skills in applied air pollution research through earning a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering or Chemical Engineering, please get in touch!

Upcoming Ph.D. projects will focus on urban and indoor air quality, with opportunities to work in the following areas:
<ul>
	<li>High-end aerosol and air quality instrumentation (Aerosol Mass Spectrometry, aerosol size distributions, and others) </li>
	<li>Mobile air pollution monitoring and spatial data analysis</li>
	<li>Emissions source characterization</li>
</ul>
These projects will be interdisciplinary and highly collaborative with other researchers at University of Arizona and beyond.
