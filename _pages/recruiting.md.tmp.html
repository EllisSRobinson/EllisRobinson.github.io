<p>I am hiring for two <b><i>funded</i></b> Ph.D. openings as I start my lab and research group. If you are interested in developing measurement and data science skills in applied air pollution research through earning a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering or Chemical Engineering, please get in touch!</p>

<p>Upcoming Ph.D. projects will focus on urban and indoor air quality, with opportunities to work in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Aerosol composition and air quality instrumentation (Aerosol Mass Spectrometry, aerosol size distributions, toxicity assays, others) </li>
    <li>Mobile air pollution monitoring and spatial data analysis</li>
    <li>Emissions source characterization</li>
</ul>

<p>These projects will be interdisciplinary and highly collaborative with other researchers at University of Arizona and beyond. </p>
